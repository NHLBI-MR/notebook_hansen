    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of some imaging experiements that are likely to be better (or challenging) with low field. When we have a system, we will march through these. \n",
    " \n",
    "* 2D selective excitation: Long T2* will help, low off resonance will help.  \n",
    "* Perfusion: It is unclear whether the lower T1 (bad) or the higher Gd relaxivity (good) will be the dominant factor.  \n",
    "* Speech imaging: Obvious benefits of low off resonance.  \n",
    "* Interventional MRI: Wires will be safe. \n",
    "* Angiography: Same questions as with perfusion, which factors will dominate.  \n",
    "* Phase contrast flow: higher Maxwell terms will be challenging.  \n",
    "* Multiband MS \u2013 Should be able to use the lower RF power deposition to get more coverage.  "
